Maswr of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treusury.

'the Lords os Her Mnjesty’s Trensury, after a careful

suggested, however, that the prefaoe to each work should
eontuiu, in addition to the parficuhxrs proposed by the
Master of tho Rolls, a bingraphical account of the author,
so fus· as authentia materiale existed for that purpose,
and an estimato of his hisborionl credibility and vulne.
